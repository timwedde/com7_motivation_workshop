Proposed Idea: **Humans don't just strive up the pyramid, but also away from the bottom**  
**Draw** opposing arrows, with reference to Maslow's pyramid

Proposed Idea: **Formalization of motivational process**  
Hypothesis: **Individuals are likely to make choices that maximize the chance of attaining a desired result**  
**Define** the three parts of the **fomula** with an **example**  
During explanation, **build model of Porter & Lawler** when a step of the formula is defined
```
- you're lying in bed and notice you're stomach rumbles -> you're quite hungry
- it is midday
- you don't have anything else to do
=> What do you do?
- get out of bed and make food (effort -> performance)
- you get to the kitchen and look around, finding several ways to make food
=> What kind of food do you make? (easy or complex)
- cornflakes vs full meal
- (performance -> outcome) (cost vs. benefit calculation, this is the initial decision on what to make)
- you resolve to make one of the options but come to find that some ingredients have gone bad, preventing you from making the meal
- you try making the other one, but find the same
- keep going until you give up
- this is (outcome -> reward), which is the reflection on what each meal will give you
    - cornflakes will momentarily sate your hunger but you know you'll have to eat again shortly
    - full meal will sate you for the longest part of the day
    - at some point, you will be given so many disincentives that you just give up: a motivational factor has flipp to the opposite
