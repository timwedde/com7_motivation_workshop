Overall Question: **What is motivation?**  
Opening statement: **I've got a motivational problem until I've got a time problem.**  
Audience Question: **Give us examples of something you did, and why you did it**  

- Why do you do chores at home?
- Why did you take up a job?
- Why did you take up this study?
- What do you do in your free time? Why?
- Why do you program?

Audience Input `->` Mind Map  
**Group** answers into **intrinsic** / **extrinsic**  
**Explain** intrinsic / extrinsic

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

**Draw** empty pyramid on board and place **jumbled tiers** next to it  
**Audience directs** us where to place tiers  
Explain Maslow and connection to Motivation

1. Physiological -> Bodily urges, requirements for human survival
2. Safety -> Removing instabilities and unknowns (war, economic instability, job security)
3. Love/Belonging -> Interaction and Assimilation into social groups (may overcome lower levels due to peer pressure)
4. Esteem -> external esteem (respect from others) and internal esteem (self-respect, self-esteem)
5. Self-Actualization -> Striving to reach one's full potential (sometimes difficult to assess)
6. (Self-Transcendence) -> Actualization as giving one's self to a higher goal outside one's own goals (provides some other levels and satisfaction)

***
* Stages of growth in humans
* Innate, instinctual drive up the pyramid
* High-level description of base desires

**Audience rates** Job Examples:
```
Order:
    A B
    A C
    B C
A: (high hygiene & high motivation)
    - permanent position
    - good relationship between colleagues (often eat together during breaks, help each other with issues (also private), friendships)
    - surpervisor is toleranty of failures, helps with problems
    - no problems with short-schedule holidays (but not in the vicinity of deadlines of bigger projects)
    - challenging tasks, wich you are allowed to plan a bit by your own
    - frequent, respectful feedback about your work (positive and negative)

B: (high hygiene & low motivation)
    - regular, defined working hours (not a lot of extra hours)
    - a very good payment
    - no promotion through good work since 3 years
    - mental underload
    - supervisor is choleric
    - just feedback when something went wrong

C: (low hygiene & high motivation)
    - temp. work of 2 years
    - complex leading hierarchy
    - pay for parking your car, and bad connection to the public transport (at least 3 hours travel time instead  of 1.5)
    - responsible for your tasks (less control)
    - profit sharing
    - possibility for promotion through good work
```
Proposed Idea: **Humans don't just strive up the pyramid, but also away from the bottom**  
**Draw** opposing arrows, with reference to Maslow's pyramid

## Expectancy Theory vs Porter & Lawler
##### 14:35

```
Proposed Idea: **Formalization of motivational process**  
Hypothesis: **Individuals are likely to make choices that maximize the chance of attaining a desired result**  
**Define** the three parts of the **fomula** with an **example**  
During explanation, **build model of Porter & Lawler** when a step of the formula is defined
```
- You're lying in bed and notice you're stomach rumbles -> you're quite hungry
- It is midday and you don't have anything else to do
=> What do you do?
- Get out of bed and make food (effort -> performance)
- You get to the kitchen and look around, finding several ways to make food
=> What kind of food do you make? (easy or complex)
- Cornflakes vs Full Meal
- (performance -> outcome) (cost vs. benefit calculation, this is the initial decision on what to make)
- You resolve to make one of the options but come to find that some ingredients have gone bad, preventing you from making the meal
- You try making the other one, but find the same
- Keep going until you give up
- This is (outcome -> reward), which is the reflection on what each meal will give you
    - Cornflakes will momentarily sate your hunger but you know you'll have to eat again shortly
    - Full meal will sate you for the longest part of the day
    - At some point, you will be given so many disincentives that you just give up: a motivational factor has flipped to the opposite
```
**Porter & Lawler:** Perceived ability to perform the task `vs` Perceived challenge of the task

## BREAK

```
Build Need-Theory triangle
```

## Flow Theory
##### 14:50
```

```
Premise: **Given optimal conditions regarding skill and challenge level, one may enter a state called _Flow_**  
**Draw** Flow Graph  
Give multiple **examples**, **Audience rates** each by putting a dot in the area most closely fitting the current state of affairs:
```
A (Apathy):
    - Basic CRUD application in Java (e.g. customer managment) with a database connection

B (Boredom/Relaxation/Control)
    - Complex customer management system with web application and database

C (Anxiety)
    - Security system for a casino which identifies potentially dangerous people

D (Flow)
    - Elevator Project
```

## Need Theory
##### 15:00
```
String
Large, colored Dots
Need-Theory triangle
```
Give a **job example** for each part of the model  
**Audience members choose** positions befitting them in the triangle  
**Explain** motivational factors for each
**Offer choice** to re-order
```
- Need for achievement
    - Regular, moderately sized IT company with good prospects for promotions but otherwise standard fare job
    - Prefer work in areas of moderate difficulty that are evaluated based on performance and the possibility of promotions (e.g. most regular office jobs)
- Need for affiliation
    - IT Consultant, heavy reliance on teamwork, meeting new people, networking, building your professional network
    - Prefer work in areas based on social interaction (e.g. customer service, marketing)
- Need for power
    - Partner in Consultancy or Team Lead in a larger company
    - Prefer work in areas that reward discipline and individual performance, mostly in a competitive, highly-hierarchical setting (dominance hierarchy, e.g. law firms)
- These factors will influence the decision making in other theories, as they prioritize different things
```

## Criticism & Final Discussion
##### 15:10
```
Whiteboard
Paper with terminology
```
Pose several questions:

- What do the proposed theories lack?
- Specific Questions:
    - Did we miss any factors (from your personal experience)?
    - Where (does / should) motivation come from?
    - How important is a "dedicated motivator" (leader) in this context?
    - **Dan Pink:** Money is not the main motivator (back-reference to maslow)
    - How important is money for your motivation?
    - **Sprenger:** Individuality, Freedom and Creativity are now driving factors
    - **Company Culture** plays a bigger role for younger generations
    - Motivation in a group? (SOFA)
    - **Back-Reference:** How would you solve the time-motivation problem (for yourself)?
