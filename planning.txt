### SCRIPT START ###

14:00 Intro
Material: WhiteBoard & WhiteBoard Maker

open with question 'what is motivation'?
gather some answers from the audience, organize in mind-map on part of board
see if we can group the answers into (intrinsic) and (extrinsic) while writing them down and get the audience to recognize that as the grouping key
then, briefly explain what those two things mean

---# segway into maslow #---

14:05 Maslow
Material: FlipChart, Paper with terminology, Magnets, later Sellotape

draw empty pyramid on the board
put up the tiers on another part of the board, jumbled
have them direct us where each part goes
(possibly ask for their reasoning)
small explanation of what the pyramid means and what it's got to do with motivation
(stages of growth in humans, innate, instinctual drive up the pyramid, high-level description of base desires)

---# segway into two-factor theory #---

14:15 two-factor
Material: Paper with examples, Magnets, WhiteBoard Marker, Flipchart

proposed idea: humans don't just strive up the pyramid, but also away from the bottom
explain based on previously created pyramid, with slight modifications, draw arrows up and down
go into discussion: job examples

---# segway into expectancy theory #---

14:25 expectancy
Material: Flipchart, paper with terminology / Whiteboard, Whiteboard marker

proposed idea: formalization and generalization of aforementioned examples of motivators and demotivators
state hypothesis: Individuals are likely to make choices that maximize the chance of attaining a desired result
this can be condensed into a formula
give an example to work out the parts of the formula (together on the board / discussion):
- you're lying in bed and notice you're stomach rumbles -> you're quite hungry
- it is midday
- you don't have anything else to do
=> What do you do?
- get out of bed and make food (effort -> performance)
- you get to the kitchen and look around, finding several ways to make food
=> What kind of food do you make? (easy or complex)
- cornflakes vs full meal
- (performance -> outcome) (cost vs. benefit calculation, this is the initial decision on what to make)
- you resolve to make one of the options but come to find that some ingredients have gone bad, preventing you from making the meal
- you try making the other one, but find the same
- keep going until you give up
- this is (outcome -> reward), which is the reflection on what each meal will give you
    - cornflakes will momentarily sate your hunger but you know you'll have to eat again shortly
    - full meal will sate you for the longest part of the day
    - at some point, you will be given so many disincentives that you just give up: a motivational factor has flipp to the opposite
we now have the whole formula on the board
mention criticism, which was probably already discovered during the discussion of the example:
    - quite simplistic / vague

---# segway into Porter & Lawler #---

14:35 Porter & Lawler
Material: Flipchart, Paper with terminology, Magnets, Sellotape

- in reference to the issues (hopefully) discovered just before, put up jumbled parts of the improved model
- assemble the model on the board with the audience

--# BREAK #---

14:45

---# segway into flow theory #---

15:00 Flow
Material: Flipchart, magnets, Dots (with colurs/num)

- given optimal or at least very good conditions in your preferred field from the previous topic, you may reach a state called "flow"
- draw the "flow" chart (hehe) and briefly explain, then move on

---# segway into need theory #---

14:50 Need
Materail: Kordel, bigger Dots (possible 2 colors)

- mention that this theory targets the "rewards" section of the previous model
- explain the three needs, with stereotypical job examples
- have each audience member prioritize among the three options

---# segway into dan pink, interesting statistics, tidbits and discussion #---

15:10 Critism
Material: Whiteboard, Paper with terminology

- mention dan pink's stance (money is not the main motivator, back-reference to maslow)
# subsections: sprenger
    - talk about 10K horses, how leadership and motivation are strongly interconnected
    - mention some interesting statistics, if available, on worker engagement

---# segway into reflection #---

15:20 Reflection
Material: Whiteboard

- final discussion: think roughly 10 years into the future:
    - in the best case scenario, where do you see yourself? what is important to you in the long run? money, family, friends, adventure?
    - in the worst case scenario, what could happen? what could go wrong along the best case scenario, due to your personality, abilities, a mismatch between your character and your goals?
        - give this as "homework" for the audience to think about, as it's probably too personal to discuss
        - make this the ending statement
