Sprenger: Management theories

1. 21st century = The age of the individual
	- individual products makes to sucess
	- to create them the employess need enough open space for each individual regarding creativity, personal responsibility and flexibility
	- regulation through reliance instead of control

2. Reliance = the basis of management
	- reliance from the chef leads to faster actions and decissions, more creativity and inovation by the employees
	- fault tolerance by the chef -> the employee is more willing to take risks -> employee gets more creative
	- reducing costs through the fact that less reports need to be created
	- create open spaces for employess -> more motivation
	- in the case the chef trust the employees, the employees feel obliged to fulfill this reliance
	
3. Destroy reliance
	- more control by the boss reduce the motivation and working morale of the employees, employees tries to work less with less risks
	- leads to a doom loop
	- to make it better, explain the problem and reduce the communication and the reliance for a limit time, after that time get reliance back
	- that should be only done twice
	
4. Motivation, not the tasks of leadership
	- increase the motivation through awards by sucess is Motivation and laedinf by foreigners (no intrinsic motivation)
	- doom loop, baecause awards by sucess needs to get bigger every time and thats get nore expensive
	- work is not in the foreground anymore, instead the awards, that leads to:
		-> loss of creativity and innovation (employees tries to satify chef)
		-> employees tries to get every time lower boundaries for getting presents
		-> competition between employees, instead of collaberation
		-> in the case the promise is not satisfy the employees gets demotivated
	- instead introduce profitsharing

5. Follow your heart = no problem with the motivation
	- intrinsic motivation is the only motiavtion, the people need to be free to deceide individual regarding every realtion
	- employee need to be ready to take personal responsibility
	- motivation only appears when employees can do activities/tasks, in which they are good and will also make them in their free time
	- they should not make thoughts about the payment

6. Education = Attribute of leadership
	- education includes knowledge about litrature, poetry, history and philosophy
	- adequate education leads to better understanding of the wishes, hopes, fears and expectations of the employees
	- education results in humanity, resoluteness, respect and adequate decrees
	- education leads to an individual leadership fitting to each employee

7. Teams producing just mediocrity
	- in the noraml case team work is against the hierarchy, so there is no competence
	- decisions are done regarding the company structure
	- the creativity and personality of each is deleted

8. Remove the employee idea system
	- employees get awards for improvments leads to a dependence
	- the employees could not make effort to be creative
