Sprenger: Management theories

1. 21st century = The age of the individual
	- individual ability is the means to success
	- to facilitate this, the employees need enough open space for each individual regarding creativity, personal responsibility and flexibility
	- regulation through reliance instead of control

2. Reliance = the basis of management
	- reliance from the boss leads to faster actions and decisions, more creativity and innovation by the employees
	- fault tolerance by the boss -> the employees are more willing to take risks -> employees get more creative
	- reducing costs through the fact that less reports need to be created
	- create open spaces for employees -> more motivation
	- in the case the boss trusts the employees, the employees feel obliged to fulfill this reliance

3. Destroy reliance
	- more control by the boss reduces motivation and working morale of the employees, employees trie to work less and take fewer risks
	- leads to a vicious circle
	- to make it better, explain the problem and reduce the communication and the reliance for a limited time, after that time get reliance back
	- that should only be done twice

4. Motivation, not the tasks of leadership
	- increase the motivation through rewards by sucess is Motivation and leading with foreigners (no intrinsic motivation)
	- vicious circle, because rewards by sucess need to get bigger every time and that gets more expensive
	- work is not in the foreground anymore, instead the rewards, which leads to:
		-> loss of creativity and innovation (employees trie to satify boss)
		-> employees trie to get lower boundaries for getting presents every time
		-> competition between employees, instead of collaboration
		-> in the case the promise is not satisfied the employees gets demotivated
	- instead introduce profit sharing

5. Follow your heart = no problem with motivation
	- intrinsic motivation is the only 'real' motiavtion, the people need to be free to decide individually regarding every relation
	- employee need to be ready to take personal responsibility
	- motivation only appears when employees can do activities/tasks in which they are good and will also do them in their free time
	- they should not have thoughts about the salary being too low

6. Education = Attribute of leadership
	- education includes knowledge about literature, poetry, history and philosophy
	- adequate education leads to better understanding of the wishes, hopes, fears and expectations of the employees
	- education results in humanity, resoluteness, respect and adequate decrees
	- education leads to an individual leadership fitting to each employee

7. Teams producing just mediocrity
	- in the normal case, team work is against the hierarchy, so there is no competence
	- decisions are made according to the company structure
	- the creativity and personality of each individual is suppressed/deleted

8. Remove the employee idea system
	- employees getting rewards for improvments leads to malevolent dependence
	- the employees will not make efforts to be creative
