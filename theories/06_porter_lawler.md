Porter/Lawler: Keeping the good stuff but making it more complicated
- Based on Expectancy Theory
- More detailed reward types:
    - Intrinsic
    - Extrinsic
- Factors in Flow Theory (perceived ability to perform the task vs. perceived challenge of the task)
- Basically replace the (Effort -> Performance) theorem with a more detailed version that factors in abilities, traits and self-perception
    - Basically just says that it's not a simple (cause -> effect) relationship
