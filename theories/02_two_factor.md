2-Factor Theory: Maslow in a Motivational Setting
- Focused on motivation in the workplace, but can partly be applied to other areas as well
- Proposes (partly) disjoint factors for satisfaction and dissatisfaction:
  DisSat.    <â‰ >       Sat.
<--------- |Limbo| --------->
- Motivation is twofold in that people will strive to distance themselves from the bad and simultaneously forge towards the good
- Dissatisfaction is often times extrinsic (determined by outer sources, e.g. work schedule, organizational structure)
- Satisfaction often times derives from intrinsic factors (e.g. sense of importance, responsibility, recognition)

- Motivators:
	+ chelleging work
	+ recognition
	+ respomsibility
- Hygiene Factors:
	+ status
	+ job security
	+ salary
	+ fringe benefits

Criticism:
- Limbo is not well-defined: depends on personality
- Logical Fallacy: Assumes completely happy and satisfied workers produce more
