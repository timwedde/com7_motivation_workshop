Expectancy Theory: Why do we do what we do? - Motivated Decision Making
- Motivation is: A process to make choices among multiple forms of *voluntary* activities (the rest is covered by Maslow)
- Hypothesis: Individuals are likely to make choices that maximize the chance of attaining a desired result
- A person will decide to take action towards a specific goal if:
    - They see a positive correlation between effort and performance (Expectancy)
    - Performance will result in a desired reward (Instrumentality)
    (
    - The reward will satisfy an (important) need
        ### OR ### (Valence)
    - The reward will make the effort worthwile enough
    )
- As a formula:
  (Effort      -> Performance) (Factor)
x (Performance -> Outcome) (Factor)
x (Outcome     -> Reward) (-1/0/+1)

Criticism:
- Too simplistic, other factors may play a role as well
- Still, good baseline, improved upon by other theories
