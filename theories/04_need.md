Need Theory: Three forces that affect people from an organizational standpoint
- Need for achievement
    - Prefer work in areas of moderate difficulty that are evaluated based on performance and the possibility of promotions (e.g. most regular office jobs)
- Need for affiliation
    - Prefer work in areas based on social interaction (e.g. customer service, marketing)
- Need for power
    - Prefer work in areas that reward discipline and individual performance, mostly in a competitive, highly-hierarchical setting (dominance hierarchy, e.g. law firms)
- These factors will influence the decision making in other theories, as they prioritize different things
