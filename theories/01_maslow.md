Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
(6)          (Self-Transcendence) -> Actualization as giving one's self to a higher goal outside one's own goals (provides some other levels and satisfaction)
 5         Self-Actualization     -> Striving to reach one's full potential (sometimes difficult to assess)
 4       Esteem                   -> external esteem (respect from others) and internal esteem (self-respect, self-esteem)
 3     Love/Belonging             -> Interaction and Assimilation into social groups (may overcome lower levels due to peer pressure)
 2   Safety                       -> Removing instabilities and unknowns (war, economic instability, job security)
 1 Physiological                  -> Bodily urges, requirements for human survival
- Humans tend to strive upwards the pyramid
- Lower levels have to be met before higher levels will be taken on
- Motivations from multiple levels can be active at the same time
